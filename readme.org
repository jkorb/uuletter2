* About

The purpose of this work is to provide a \LaTeX document class
(=uuletter2.cls=) for writing letters that comply with the Utrecht
University (UU) Corporate Idenity.[FN:1]

The class is loaded like any other document class by means of the
command =\documentclass[<options>]{uuletter2}=. For a description of
the options, see below.

By default (i.e. if you select no options), the letter is set in the
standard sans serif font, at 10 pt font size with the usual \LaTeX
justification, on a4 paper, and with an English language header. There
is an option (=dutch=), which typesets the header in Dutch.

Note that this is a beta-version. I haven't tested the class much
beyond the templates and only on my personal Macbook Pro running
Catalina with MacTex 2019. I'd very much appreciate bug reports to
j.korbmacher@uu.nl and will keep this updated. In the next days, I
also put this on code on github.

[FN:1] There exists a class called =uuletter.cls= at
https://svn.science.uu.nl/index.php?RID=657 but it appears a bit dated. 

* Installation and Dependencies

The simplest way to use the class is to include the actual style file
(=uuletter2.cls=), the logos (with their original file names,
#+BEGIN_CENTER
=UU_logo_EN_CMYK.png= 
and
 =UU_logo_NL_CMYK.png=,
#+END_CENTER
available under
https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/corporate-identity/downloads/logo,
heading "LOGOS FOR DIGITAL APPLICATIONS"), and the signature file
(which must be named =signature-uuletter.png=, default "John Hancock" provided)
in whatever directory you want to compile your letter.

If you like the class and want to make it available for every \LaTeX
file you compile on your computer, you need to put the files somewhere
in the TDS (TeX Directory Structure). For Mac, I recommend:

+ Put =uuletter2.cls= in
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  =Users/<username>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/uuletter2=
#+END_CENTER 
  If that directory doesn't exist, it's safe to create it.
+ Put the logo files (with their original file names,
  =UU_logo_EN_CMYK.png= and =UU_logo_NL_CMYK.png=) in
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  =Users/username/Library/texmf/tex/latex/uuletter2/logos/=
#+END_CENTER
 Again, safe to create.
+ Put the signature file named =signature-uuletter.png= in
#+BEGIN_CENTER
  =Users/username/Library/texmf/tex/latex/uuletter2/signature/=
#+END_CENTER
Also
  safe to create). A default file with a "John Hancock" is
  included. If you want to use your own scanned signature, you can use
  any .png file that you rename =signature-uuletter.png=. For a good
  result, I'd recommend not exceeding 4-5 cm of picture width.

Note that =Users/<username>/Library/= is by default a hidden folder in
MacOS. You can use Command+Shift+Dot in the folder =Users/<username>/=
to make it visible. Otherwise, use the internet to figure it out.

For other Unix systems (e.g. Linux) or Windows you're on your own (for
now). 

The class loads the following packages:
+ =inputenc= with the =utf8= option (this might be a bad idea, let me
  know if that messes things up).
+ =babel= with the provided langauge option (see below, default: english)
+ =graphicx= with no options (to include the logo and signature)
+ =hyperref= with =colorlinks=false= to have clickable links for the
  homepage and email in the header (I might also kick that one out).

This means that you don't need to load these packages anymore, unless
you want to change their options. You're free to load other packages,
but I haven't explored any possible compatability issues. Since the
class was written from scratch I /hope/ there are none, but that might
be folly.

* Package options

The package has the following options:
+ =dutch=
Typesets a letter according to the Dutch template. With this option,
the package loads =babel= with the =dutch= option, displays the Dutch
language UU logo, and the labels in the header are printed in Dutch.
+ =english= (Default)
Typesets a letter according to the English template. With this option,
the package loads =babel= with the =english= option (/not/ =british=),
displays the English language UU logo, and the labels in the header
are printed in English.
+ =sans= (Default)
Typesets the letter in the (default) sans-serif font family. Also
loads =fontenc= with the =T1= option.
+ =roman= 
Typesets the letter in the (default) roman font family.  Also loads
=fontenc= with the =T1= option.
+ =verdana=
Typesets the letter in 9 pt Verdana (if the font is found on the local
machine). With this option, the letter corresponds to the Brand Policy
of the University.  *Warning:* This option is implemented via the
=fontspec= package, which requires compilation with XeLaTex (which is
relatively easy in, say, TeX Shop).
+ =ragged= 
Typesets the letter with right-ragged justification. This makes the
result look like the Word templates, but is not recommended for
serious letters.
+ =justified= (Default)
Typsets the letter with standard, \LaTeX justification. Much
preferrable.
+ =10pt= (Default), =11pt=, =12pt=
Changes font size as usual in \LaTeX. These options only work in
combination with the (default) =sans= option and the =roman=
option. They do /not/ work with the =verdana= option, the reasoning
being that the university wants Verdana to be typeset in 9 pt and only
Verdana is actually properly readable at such a small size.

Note that these are /all/ the class options. Some optionns you might
be used to, like, say, =a5paper=, are not available. I'll consider
including other options upon request.

* Commands

To begin simply put =\opening{<Salutation>}=
somewhere after =\begin{document}= and start writing your letter. To
finish, use =\closing{<Greeting>}= when you're done. So do something
like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
\documentclass{uuletter2}
\begin{document}
\opening{Hello there,}
This is a really short letter.
\closing{Bye bye,}
\end{document} 
#+END_EXAMPLE

For a more elaborate examples, see the provided templates.

Note that =\closing{<Greeting>}= accepts an optional argument, as in
#+BEGIN_CENTER
=\closing[<Sign as>]{<Greeting>}=
#+END_CENTER
which tells \LaTeX how you'd like
to sign your letter. By default, the class uses the sender name
provided via the =\name{<Name>}= macro (see below), but there are
conveivable situations where you might want to toy around with this:
e.g. the sender is the Department but you want to sign with your name,
the letter head should include your full name and title (prof. dr. dr. so
and so, provided via =\name{prof. dr. dr. so and so}=) but you want to
sign with your first name, etc.

You can invoke these commands multiple times in a single .tex file to
create multiple letters in the same pdf. Note that
=\opening{<Salutation>}= creates the letter head and
=\closing{<Greeting>}= the signature. Please use both in every letter
you want to create. If you want, you can leave their arguments
empty. Note that if you don't include the =\closing= command, the page
numbers will not be typset properly. 

You provide the information \LaTeX needs to compose the letter (your
names, addresses, etc.) via the macros explained in the following
section. These macros fall into two categories: global and
local. This distinction only really matters if you want to write more
than one letter in the same .tex file (if that's not your thing, just
ignore the labels and use the commands as described/desired). The main
difference between the two is that local macros are reset after each
=\closing=, meaning that if you want to write a new letter, you need
to provide these macros again. This is to avoid accidentally including
the wrong information. Global macros are /not/ reset, but /can/ be
manually re-defined.

** Global Commands

+ =\name[<Function>]{<Your Name>}=
This command tells the class which name to use as the sender and,
optionally, your function. Say, =\name[Head of HR]{dr. LÃ¼denscheidt}=. Since this is the sender's name in the
letter head, you should provide full academic titles as you'd like to
see them in the letter. You can use a more informal address as the
optional argument for =\closing=.
+ =\subsender{<Subsender>}=
Best used to name the Department, Institute, etc. where you work. You
can also use this to make clear that this letter comes from the head
of department, say.
+ =\visitingaddress{<Address>}=
Provides your visiting address. You can use =\\= to insert newlines in
the argument.
+ =\telephone{<phone number>}=
Provides your phone number.
+ =\fax{<fax number>}=
Provides your fax number (if that's your thing).
+ =\email{<email>}=
Provides your email address. This is typeset as a clickable =mailto:=
link.
+ =\website{<website>}=
Provides your website (university or otherwise) as a clickable link.

Of these global commands, only phone, fax, email, and website should
really be left out and only in case you don't want to provide them. If
an argument is empty or not used, the corresponding line (and label)
are not printed. But watch out for stray spaces. E.g. =\fax{ }= will
include the fax label with no fax number following it (a simple space
actually), while =\fax{}= doesn't print the label. This is a small bug
(or rather possibly unexpected behavior), which I might fix in the
future. 

** Local Commands

Note that these are all reset by =\closing=!

+ =\toname{<name>}=
	Defines the recipients name. Used for generating the address
  field. If there should be no address field, the name can be put in
  the opening (see below). Not printed if not defined.
+ =\toaddress{<street + no//zipcode + city//country>}=
  Defines the address of the recipient. Is used together with
  =\recipientname{}= for generating the address field. Not printed if
  not defined.
+ =\pobox{<PO Box 99999>}=
  Defines the PO Box (as per the university template).
+ =\subject{<Letter of Reference for Student>}=
Defines the subject of the letter. Goes into the letter
  details if defined, otherwise not printed.
+ =\reference{<FMTUIT/2011/WK/IDEB>}=
	Defines the sender's reference for the letter. Goes into the
  letter details if defined, otherwise not printed.
+ =\yourreference{<2012/103/MV/ws>}=
	Defines the recipient's reference for the letter. Goes into
  the letter details if defined, otherwise not printed.
+ =\enclosure{<This important document, that important document>}=
Defines the enclosures of the letter. Goes into the letter
  details if defined, otherwise not printed.
+ =\date{<dd-mm-yyyy>}=
  Defines the date of the letter. If undefined or empty, \today is
  printed in UU's preferred <dd-mm-yyyy> style..
+ =\withsignature=
Binary option, prints a digital signature (image) from the path
provide by =\signaturepath{}= (global command). As a local command,
=\withsignature= is reset at the end of each letter.

** Available environments

Many but not all usual \LaTeX environments are available. At the
moment the following are available: =enumerate=, =itemize=,
=description=, =quote=, and =quotation=. Note that
=\footnote{<footnote>}= is currently /not/ available. I'm not sure if
it's needed. If you think it is, let me know and I'll include it in
the next version. Same goes for other commands, environments that I
haven't thought of. Let me know.
